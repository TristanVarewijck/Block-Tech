![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/npm)
## Description 

I am a Communication & Multimedia Design student at the Asmterdam university of applied sciences and i am currently in me second year. 
For this block (block-web) I have the case to build a feature for a matching-app. The app is a app where people can make groups or find groups to join. 
The groups you can join have limitations: activities, duration, date, location and number of people. If you joined a group, you have find your 'match' and hopefully have a good time! In this project i am going to make a filter feature where people can based there group on or can find a group with. For the making of this feature we will be using back-end and front-end tools. 


## Feature requirements

- Activities
